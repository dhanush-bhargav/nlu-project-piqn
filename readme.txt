The Jupyter Notebook `multiconer_run.ipynb` contains all the steps to train and evaluate the PIQN model on the MultiCoNER dataset.
All results are logged into the terminal and saved in the checkpoints directory.
Make sure the path arguments in `flat.conf` and `batch_eval.conf` point to the correct paths before running.
